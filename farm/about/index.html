							<p>At Silver Oak Farm, we see our mission as three fold:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>We strive for excellence in the production of huacaya breeding stock of the finest conformation, lasting fleece quality, and disposition.</li>
								<li>We diligently work to ensure our animals have outstanding physical and emotional care, in a safe, serene environment.</li>
								<li>We commit ourselves to the utmost integrity and dependability in serving our customers from <em>day-one</em> and into the future.</li>
							</ul>
							<hr />
							<p>Silver Oak Farm, located in the Western Mountains of Maine, continues a centuries-old tradition of farming on hilltop pastures, bounded by the stone walls of our early New England predecessors. For now, these fields are entrusted to us and it is with reverence for the land, and the animals now grazing in it, that we engage in this wonderful vocation of alpaca farming. No, there is not a single <em>silver oak</em> on this farm! Our farm name derives from Mark's first career, as a U.S. Air Force officer, from which he retired in 2002 at the rank of Lt. Col., the insignia for which is a silver oak leaf. Pam, an environmental lawyer in her prior life, is our full-time farm manager, while Mark divides his time bewteen farming and his work as a government contractor for the Air Force.</p>
							<p>At present, we have a small, but highly select, herd of huacaya alpacas. Each of our foundation females and herdsires is selected carefully and deliberately.  Every animal in our foundation herd is exceptional, having won multiple show ribbons at Level 4 or 5 AOBA certified shows. Both for the growth of our herd and to provide an array of exceptional choices for our customers, we are focused on maintaining the highest quality breeding stock with the goal of producing alpacas with fiber that ranks at the forefront of this evolving industry. We breed for alpacas with fleeces of outstanding and long-lasting fineness, consistency, and density, in an array of colors, in particular white, fawn, and grey.</p>
							<p>As a full-time farm, we are dedicated to providing extraordinary customer support and to maintaining solid, long-term, and candid relationships with our customers, as well as throughout the alpaca industry. We look forward to working with our customers in every aspect of alpaca care and management.</p>
							<p>Finally, in our business philosophy, we place honesty and integrity at the forefront - hence our motto:</p>
							<h2>"Integrity breeds serenity"</h2>
