							<h1>Why Silver Oak?</h1>
							<hr />				
						</div>
						<div id="info">		
							<p><i>The economic recession has hit farmers and small businesses hard; alpaca farmers are no exception.  At Silver Oak Farm, we’ve been weathering the economic downturn relatively well.  We believe there are two primary reasons why we've done as well as we have and continue to be able to sell animals, breeding and agistment (boarding) services, and alpaca products, even in this down economy.  We believe these attributes also serve our customers well.</i></p>
							<p><i>First, we've educated ourselves about alpacas, their care, and the alpaca industry to a greater extent than many small and mid-sized breeders.</i> This has allowed us to discriminate between so-so, good, and very good animals and has led us to make smart breeding decisions that resulted in some very high quality animals that are competitive with or exceed the quality of animals produced by some of the largest and most experienced farms.  One of these truly exceptional “home-grown” alpacas, Lyra, was sold in 2010 to the nation's largest farm in Ohio.  They entered her fleece in the national fleece show that year and came away with the white female reserve championship -- #2 white female in the show.  The same farm entered Lyra's 4-year-old fleece in the 2012 national show and this time won the white female championship -- best white female in show!  Lyra’s full sister, Luna, was born at Silver Oak in summer 2012; we are hoping Luna will follow in her big sister's footsteps.</p>
							<p>Our current and prospective customers appreciate our knowledge about assessing and caring for these animals.  It builds their confidence that they're buying something worth the money their paying, and that they will be able to successfully care for and manage the animals at their farm.  We also provide extensive after-sale support, which our customers also greatly appreciate.</p>
							<p><i>The second primary reason for our success to date is hard work in marketing, as well as committed industry involvement.</i> Five or ten years ago, nearly all alpacas were worth a lot of money and it wasn't hard to sell them.  In many cases, the animals were essentially selling themselves.  The maturation of the industry, along with the recession, brought us all back to reality.  As a result, we know that a relatively small number of potential breeding alpacas are worth a lot of money.  The biggest impact to alpaca pricing has been in the middle quality range of breeding animals.  Alpacas that routinely fetched $15,000 - $25,000, or more, several years ago are now often selling in the $4,000 - $8,000 range.  Part of the downward pressure on pricing is coming from farms getting out of the business.  To get rid of their herds as fast as they can, many of them are offering their animals at “fire sale” prices.  To help a customer understand why he or she should pay $6,000 - $8,000 or more for some of our alpacas, when another alpaca somewhere else may be available for $1,000, requires not just good marketing, but the ability to clearly explain and show the attributes of high quality alpacas, in ways that our customers can really understand and appreciate.  As experienced breeders know, alpacas vary widely in quality.  To build a high quality herd, one needs to start with high quality animals.  We help our customers define, and then achieve, their goals, whether it be a breeding herd capable of producing top-notch animals and fiber, a more modest mid-range fiber-producing herd, or a small herd of pet-quality animals.</p>
							<p>Part of our marketing effort is to establish our "brand," which requires that we keep ourselves, our animals, and our fiber products visible to the rest of the alpaca community and to prospective customers.  So, we actively participate in shows, festivals, and other public events as much as we can.  As part of our "face to the public" approach, Mark has presented a seminar on tax advantages for small and startup farms at alpaca shows and fiber festivals for several years now.  His latest seminar is on fiber testing statistics, which he developed to help non-statisticians understand the numbers resulting from laboratory fiber tests, including what these statistics tell us – and can’t tell us – about our animals’ fiber.  Mark has presented this seminar several times at alpaca shows in the New England region to appreciative audiences who were brave enough to attend a seminar with the word “statistics” in the title!</p>
							<p>Pam has actively devoted countless hours as both a member of the Board of Directors and as President of the New England Alpaca Owners & Breeders Association (NEAOBA).  These efforts, including spearheading NEAOBA’s annual fall alpaca show in both 2011 and 2012, help support the industry as a whole, and northeast breeders in particular.  Silver Oak’s continuing involvement with and support of the alpaca community at large is very important to us!</p>
							<p><i>We believe that despite these challenging economic times, it is still possible to build a sustainable business as an alpaca farmer, but it requires education, hard work, and marketing.  It's definitely not a business that runs itself, nor is it the get rich quick scheme that some folks thought it was years ago.  At Silver Oak, we are committed to helping our customers develop the skills and strategies that will enable them to build their own successful alpaca farms.</i></p>
