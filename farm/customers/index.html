							<p>This is what a few of our customers have to say about Silver Oak Farm!</p>
							<div style="padding:0.5em 3em 0em 4em">
								<p>A very sincere thank you to Mark &amp; Pam Welty of Silver Oak Farm for their continuing help and advice in establishing our new alpaca farm. The quality of the alpacas we obtained from them will make us proud to raise alpacas. When you say someone goes that extra mile to help you, they do it times 10!<br /><br />Bill &amp; Miriel Dorsey<br />Paca-Luv Alpaca Farm<br />Pascoag, RI</p>
								<hr />
								<p>Mark, thank you for the quick and very informative reply.  I would add one other factor to Pam's and your success -- quiet passion!  Both of you have your hearts and souls in the business and in the welfare of your animals.  And both of you love to tell your success story to others in or entering the business.  Didn't someone say "success breeds success"?<br /><br />Ron Adams</p>
								<hr />
								<p>We want to really thank you for the exceptional example you were to us. Hope we will be able to carry the torch the way you do.<br /><br />J &amp; J<br />Worthington, MA</p>
								<hr />
								<p>So glad the Sentinel did an article about you and your husband ….We had such a wonderful time when we came to your Open House...more people should know about your farm and have the opportunity to experience what we did....<br /><br />Betsy</p>
								<hr />
								<p>I want to formally thank you for the great care you take — both of my alpacas and me!  Your farm is incredible…always a joy to visit.  You make me feel so very welcome.  You also take wonderful care of my geldings, my breeding female, and her two crias.  Your advice has always been helpful and reasonable.  I recognize that you regularly go out of your way to be of help to me.  Thank you so very much.<br /><br />Pat<br />Westminster, MA</p>
								<hr />
								<p>Ty and Lux are doing great!  We love their tranquil nature and individual personalities.  Thank you so much for your help in making our transition to alpaca ownership so easy!  You truly care about your “kids” and the customers you entrust them to.  It shows in your attention to detail and going the extra mile.  We really appreciated the extra time you took on instructing us how to do the monthly injections and nail trimming and transporting our new gate as we didn’t have a truck to pick it up ourselves.<br /><br />We would highly recommend anyone to purchase their herd from you.  They won’t regret it.  Through this entire process, we feel we gained new friends.<br /><br />Kim and Pat<br />Westmoreland, NH</p>
								<hr />								
								<p>I recommend Pam Welty and all Silver Oak Farm products and services without reservation.  We brought our angora goats there for breeding and during those three weeks, our goats received as good or better care than we give them ourselves.  The attention to detail at Silver Oak Farm encompasses all aspects of animal husbandry from nutrition to cleanliness to appropriate housing to paperwork.  They are very generous with their time and answer all questions thoroughly.<br /><br />Mary Ellen<br />Pepperell MA</p>
